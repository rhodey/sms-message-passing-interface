sms-message-passing-interface
=============================

Old POC from a few years back. Uses a Google Voice account to set up a message passing
operation between two victims. Authentication with Google is done through a PHP class which
can be found here: https://github.com/aaronpk/Google-Voice-PHP-API

I don't have much interest in maintaining or adding functionality to this project, however
before I lay it to rest I'd like to switch from JavaScript prompts to something a bit more
modern, CSS divs or something.
