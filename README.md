sms-message-passing-interface
=============================

Old project from a few years back. Used a Google Voice account to set up a message passing
operation between two victims. Authentication with Google was done through a now broken
PHP class which can be found here: http://github.com/aaronpk

The entire project is a pretty neat POC in my opinion. If anyone ever finds another way
to authenticate and interface with Google Voice I'd love to bring this back to life.
